# Social Engineering Techniques
- **Social Engineering** is an attack against a user, and typically involves some form of social interaction

- Techniques include
	- making it seem as if you belong to the group to gain unauthorized access
	- creating a hostile situation
	- stereotypical behavior (flirting, etc)

## Methods of Social Engineering
- Tools
	- A social engineer's biggest tool is their knowledge of psychology
- Phishing
- Smishing
	- phishing over SMS on cell phones
- Vishing
	- phishing over voice communications
- Spam
	- bulk unsolicited email that may include malicious attatchments or links
- Spam over Instant Messaging (SPIM)
- Spear Phishing
	- targeted attacks
- Dumpster Diving
- Shoulder Surfing
- **Pharming**
	- misdirecting users to fake websites made to look official
- Tailgaiting/Piggybacking
- Eliciting Information
- Whaling
	- Spear phishing on a high value target
- Prepending
	- Using the psychological constructs of authority, an attacker can use prepending by stating that they were sent by the target’s boss, or another authority figure, as a means to justify why the target should perform a specific action
- Identity Fraud
- Invoice Scams
	- use a fake invoice in an attempt to get a company to pay for things it has not ordered
- Credential Harvesting
	- the collection of credential information
- Reconnaissance
- Hoax
	- hoaxes can cause people to take an action that results in lowered security
- Impersonation
- Third-Party Authorization - the attacker
	- arrives with something the victim is quasi-expecting or would see as normal,
	- uses the guise of a project in trouble or some other situation where the attacker will be viewed as helpful or as someone not to upset
	- name-drops the contact “Mr. Big,” who happens to be out of the office and unreachable at the moment, thus avoiding the reference check
- Contractors/Outside Parties
- Online Attacks
- Defenses
	- A training and awareness program is still the best defense against social engineering attacks.
- Watering Hole Attack
	- attackers can plant malware at sites where users are likely to frequent.
- Typosquatting
	- g0ogle.com instead of google.com
	- rbfc.com instead of rbfcu.org
- Pretexting
	- the attacker uses a narrative (the pretext) to influence the victim into giving up some item of information
	- The main goal of the attacker is to gain the target’s trust and exploit it.
- Influence Campaigns
	- the use of collected information and selective publication of material to key individuals in an attempt to alter perceptions and change people’s minds on a topic
## Principles (Reasons for Effectiveness)
- Two reasons why social engineering is so successful
	- The basic desire of most people to be helpful
	- People normally seek to avoid confrontation/trouble

- Principles of social engineering
	- Authority
	- Intimidation
	- Consensus
	- Scarcity
	- Familiarity
	- Trust
	- Urgency
- Defenses
	- Visitor access
	- Rules before assisting a customer
	- Verifying requests as legitimate before sharing certain sensitive elements
	- **the critical element is employee training**
	- have multiple layers of defenses, including approvals and related safeguards so that a single mistake from an employee will not give away the keys to the kingdom
