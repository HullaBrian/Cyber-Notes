- Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
	- characterized by using toolkits to achieve a presence on a target network and then, instead of just moving to steal information, focusing on the long game by maintaining a persistent presence on the target network
	- 3 goals
		- Maintain continual access
		- Remain undetected
		- Steal something of value on the network
- Insider Threats
- State Actors
- Hacktivists
- Script Kiddies
- Criminal Syndicates

- Hackers: anyone who improperly uses computers
	- Authorized / White Hat
	- Unauthorized / Black Hat
	- Semi-authorized / Gray Hat
		- often violate ethics and laws, but do not always have the same malicious intent as black hat hackers.
- Shadow IT
	- People performing IT functions outside of the central IT department
- Competitors
	- Sometimes competing firms attack each other

- Attributes of Actors
	- Interl/External
	- Level of Sophistication/Capability
	- Resources/Funding
	- Intent/Motivation

- Vectors
	- Direct Access
	- Wireless
	- E-mail
	- Supply Chain
	- Social Media
	- Removable Media
	- Cloud

- Threat Intelligence Sources
	- Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
	- Closed/Proprietary
	- Vulnerability Databases
		- National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
	- Public/Private Information Sharing Centers
		- Anonymous real-time sharing of information between members to improve overall security postures.
	- Dark Web

- Indicators of Compromise
	- Anomalies in privileged user account activity
	- Geographical irregularities in network traffic
	- Account login red flags
	- Increases in database read volumes
	- HTML response sizes
	- Large numbers of requests for the same file
	- Mismatched port-application traffic, including encrypted traffic on plain ports
	- Suspicious registry or system file changes
	- Unusual DNS requests
	- Unexpected patching of systems
	- Mobile device profile changes
	- Bundles of data in the wrong place
	- Web traffic with nonhuman behavior
	- Signs of DDoS activity, even if temporary

- Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)
	- an automated, bidirectional cyber-threat indicator method thatâ€™s used for reporting
- Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) / Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII)
	- STIX is a standardized, machine-readable (yet also human-readable) structured language to represent cyber-threat information
	- TAXII defines a set of services and message exchanges that enable the automated sharing of actionable cyber-threat information across organizational, product line, and service boundaries
	- **TLDR; TAXII represents the transport method, and STIX represents the message.**
