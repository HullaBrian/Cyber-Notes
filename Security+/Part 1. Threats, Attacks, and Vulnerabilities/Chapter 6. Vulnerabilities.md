- Cloud-based vs. On-premises Vulnerabilities
- Zero Day
	- Compensating controls block the path to the vulnerability rather than directly addressing it
- Weak Configurations
- Open Permissions
- Insecure Root Accounts
- Errors (should be trapped)
- Weak encryption
	- making your own algorithm or implementation
	- using a deprecated/weak cryptographic algorithm
- Insecure protocols
	- HTTP instead of HTTPS
- Default Settings
- Open Ports and Services
- Third Party Risks
	- outsourcing code development, storage in the cloud
- Vendor Management
- System Integration
	- Integrations can have gaps and configuration requirements that lead to risk
- Lack of Vendor Support
	- End of Life: something has reached the end of its useful life
	- End of Service Life: manufacturer stops selling something
- Supply Chain
- Outsourced Code Development
- Data Storage
- Improper or Weak Patch Management
	- When a company issues a patch, attackers can reverse engineer the exploit from it. Making sure the enterprise has a strong patch management system is vital
- Firmware
- Operating Systems (OS)
	- PATCH YOUR STUFF DUDE
- Applications
- Legacy Platforms: systems no longer supported/marketed

- Impacts
	- Data Loss
	- Data Breaches
	- Data Exfiltration
	- Identity Theft
	- Financial
	- Reputation
	- Availability loss
