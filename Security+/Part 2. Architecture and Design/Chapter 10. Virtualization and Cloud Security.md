# Cloud Models
## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- cloud-based systems delivered as a virtual solution for computing
- Pay-per-use basis, scalable directly with need
## Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- The offering of a computing platform in the cloud
- Multiple sets of software working together to provide a platform (database services) can be delivered as a platform
- Focuses on security and scalability
## Software as a Service (SaaS)
- offering software to end users
- software runs in the cloud, rather than on the end-users machine
	- Microsoft Office 365 and Adobe Creative Cloud Suite
## Anything as a Service (XaaS)
- Something like Disaster Recovery as a Service
- The wrapping of other cloud models (SaaS and IaaS)
## Levels of Control with Cloud Models
<img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781260464016/files/F10-01.jpg">
## Public
- Cloud for public use
- Significantly fewer security restrictions
## Community
- A shared cloud for several organizations with a common interest
- Attractive cost sharing mechanism
## Private
- Significantly more secure than Community/Public
	- Better able to define security policies, processing, and handling of data
- VERY expensive
## Hybrid
- A system that combines other Cloud models
# Managed Service Provider (MSP) / Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)
- MSPs are companies that remotely manage IT infrastructure
- MSSP does the same thing as a third party that manages security services
- Upside is scalability
- Downside is anything more you want them to do, you have to renegotiate the contract
# Fog Computing
- using someone else’s computers
- Fog computing is a distributed form of cloud computing, in which the workload is performed on a distributed, decentralized architecture
- devices mediate processing between local hardware and remote servers.
# Edge Computing
- Computing done at the edge of the network
- edge computing brings processing closer to the edge of the network, which optimizes web applications and IoT devices.
# Thin Client
- A lightweight computer whose primary goal is to communicate with another machine - usually a more powerful server
# Containers
- Containers are a form of operating system virtualization. They are a packaged-up combination of code and dependencies that help applications run quickly in different computing environments.
# Infrastructure as Code
- Allows for programmatic management of physical hardware configurations
# Serverless Architecture
- Know that serverless architecture is a way to develop and run applications and services without owning and managing an infrastructure. Servers are still used, but they are owned and managed “off-premises.”
# Virtualization
## Type I Hypervisor
- Run directly on system hardware
## Type II Hypervisor
- Run on top of a host operating system
- Think VirtualBox or VMWare Player
## VM Sprawl Avoidance
- Sprawl is having wayyyy too many vms to where you lose track of them
- Avoid through policy
	- naming conventions
	- proper storage architecture (proper folder layout and organization)
